## Easily Transpose Chord Progressions

 This is a simple app that lets you input a chord progression, and transpose it up or down a given number of half steps. It's useful for finding a key that fits your voice without having to put in the mental effort of transposing the chords a bunch of times.

Built using flask for the backend, and HTML and CSS for the front-end.
